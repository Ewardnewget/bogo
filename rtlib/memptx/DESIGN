the whole scan process is partationed into slow path and fast path

Fast path: we scan hot pages for temporal locality reason,
buffer the free(ptr) and postpone scanning of cold pages to slow path.
and this will make sure that all hot pages are up to date.

Slow path can be run on another core using spearate worker thread.
If the main process experienced mprotect error due to this unfinished slow path,
we stop it and wait and try again.
Or, at the time of fault caused by mprotect, scan it against the free(ptr)_queue.
and select victim in hot pages and put it to hot pages list.

when free(ptr) queue is full, scan all pages against free(ptr)queue and flush
the queue.
